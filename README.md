# UTS_Gorontalo_Sanggala
This is a temporary repository for a Universal Dependencies-annotated treebank of Gorontalo, in connection with the upcoming paper:


> Andrew Dyer and Colleen Alena O'Brien, _Towards better annotation practices for symmetrical voice in Universal Dependencies_, Universal Dependencies Workshop at Syntaxfest, Ljubljana, August 2025


The current location is temporary as our project is at an early stage of getting feedback and establishing ideas.
Once an official Universal Dependencies repository has been created, a redirection to that repository will be given here.

The name _Sanggala_ is from a Gorontalo dish of fried flour-coated bananas, and is a temporary name assigned while we decide on the permanent name. Or it may become permanent, who knows.

The prefix _UTS_ stands for UniDive Training School, and is a prefix that was applied to practice annotation corpora at the UniDive Training School in Chisinau, Moldova, 2024. We use it for this repository to avoid a name conflict with the later UD repository.
